## Building a Real Time Chat Application with Spring Boot and Websocket

## What is Websocket?
>  WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
>  WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. The protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.
